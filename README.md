## What is it?

CosmOS is a toy operating system I am writing in golang. This is mostly just a sadistic project to see if I can get something running. 

> :warning: **Fair Warning**: The code will be messy and most likely unmaintainable. I will try to keep it clean, but no guarantees!

## Why is it?

Mostly because I want to. Another part is I am interested in kernel and operating systems development. Yet another is because why not in golang?!?!
